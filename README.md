# Employee Data Cleaning & Analytics Pipeline

An end-to-end Data Engineering project demonstrating data validation, cleaning, SQL business views, and Tableau dashboard development using a real-world employee dataset.

---

# Project Overview

This project focuses on transforming raw employee data into business-ready datasets.

The workflow starts with a messy employee dataset, performs data validation and cleaning using Python and Pandas, loads the cleaned data into MySQL, creates SQL business views, and finally visualizes key business insights through an interactive Tableau dashboard.

# Dashboard Insights

### Average & Maximum Salary Per Department

Compares department-wise average salary against maximum salary to identify compensation trends.

### Workforce Distribution

Displays employee count across different regions and departments.

### Regional Salary Analysis

Shows how average salaries vary across multiple states.

### Performance Chart

Provides an overall comparison of departmental salary performance.

### Interactive Filters

Users can filter dashboard results by:

- Department
- Region

# SQL Views

Business views were created for reporting purposes.

Example:

- Department Summary
- Regional Workforce Summary
- Salary Summary

These views simplify reporting and improve dashboard performance.
